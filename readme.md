# Phaser3 Dungeon Crawler

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a package manager (I use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js.

Install Node.js with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Then install Parcel:

```bash
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

## Getting Started

Start development server:

```
yarn start
```

To create a production build:

```
yarn build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. 🎉

## Project Structure

```
    .
    ├── dist
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    │   ├── scenes
    │   │   ├── GameScene.ts
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── main.ts
    ├── package.json
```

The contents of this template is the basic [Phaser3 getting started example](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part5).

## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served at http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    ├── images
    │   ├── my-image.png
    ├── music
    │   ├── ...
    ├── sfx
    │   ├── ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

## TypeScript ESLint

This template uses a basic `typescript-eslint` set up for code linting.

It does not aim to be opinionated.

## Other Notes

[parcel-plugin-clean-easy](https://github.com/lifuzhao100/parcel-plugin-clean-easy) is used to ensure only the latest files are in the `dist` folder. You can modify this behavior by changing `parcelCleanPaths` in `package.json`.

[parcel-plugin-static-files](https://github.com/elwin013/parcel-plugin-static-files-copy#readme) is used to copy static files from `public` into the output directory and serve it. You can add additional paths by modifying `staticFiles` in `package.json`.
